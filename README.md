## Description

This week, we were tasked with building a tech blog from scratch, getting back to front-end coding with a full-stack challenge. We were instructed to use the MVC paradigm, which has been very interesting to work with. At times, I thought my brain was melting, and at other times I felt like I mostly understood everything I was doing. I learned a lot about using the front-end and the back-end all together and how both complicated and simplified it can be doing it all on your own. I'm also really glad I got some experience from working on this before really diving into group project week.
